## Introduction

> "Be the change that you wish to see in the world." - Mahatma Gandhi

The climate crisis is an existential threat to humanity. Despite global efforts to transition to renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency, carbon dioxide levels continue to rise, exacerbating global warming and its catastrophic consequences. All indications show that emissions will never go to zero, and the fossil fuel industry will continue for the foreseeable future. Clearly, a solution is required, and any solution must entail a truly scalable carbon capture solution to not only be envisioned but created, operated, and maintained.

While various methods of carbon capture and storage (CCS) have been proposed and tested, none scale to the size of the challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to CCS using cyanobacteria as a biologically based solution to capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We aim to provide a comprehensive, viable and sustainable solution to one of the most pressing issues of our time.



## Key Factors and Calculations

> "In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity." - Albert Einstein

The growth rate of some types of cyanobacteria is about 0.41 per day. In specialized growth systems called photobioreactors, the density of these microorganisms can reach beyond 7 billion cells per milliliter, which is roughly equivalent to 8 grams per liter. The carbon content in cyanobacteria is roughly half of its dry weight. Using these numbers, we estimate that cyanobacteria could capture at least 4 grams of carbon per liter per day. Capturing 1 ton of carbon would equate to approximately 3.66 tons of CO2 captured. And that's before optimization and genetic engineering.

### Global Context

To put this into perspective, let's consider that global carbon dioxide emissions are approximately 50 billion tons per year. At the estimated rate of 4 grams of carbon capture per liter per day, it would require about 13.7 trillion liters of cyanobacteria to offset global emissions every year.

### Perspective on 13.7 Trillion Liters

To truly comprehend the staggering volume of 13.7 trillion liters required for this endeavor, consider that it would be roughly equivalent to 1.14 times the volume of Lake Superior — one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world. While the scale of this project may evoke disbelief or even ridicule, it's crucial to remember that the climate crisis leaves us with limited options. The sheer size of this project is not a whimsical exaggeration but a sobering necessity. Faced with the existential threat of unchecked global CO2 emissions, the issue is not whether a project of this monumental scale is too ambitious; rather, it's that the severity of the climate crisis demands solutions of equivalent scale. Anything less would be a failure to meet the challenge before us.


### Improvements and Optimizations

Genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics are poised to revolutionize the efficacy and scalability of this carbon capture initiative. Through genetic engineering, we aim to develop hyper-efficient strains of cyanobacteria that not only excel in carbon capture but are also optimized for ease of harvest. Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning algorithms, will continuously fine-tune growth conditions, ensuring peak carbon capture performance around the clock. Automation and robotics will be indispensable in achieving cost-effective, uninterrupted operation enabling relentless carbon sequestration.


## Our Cyanobacteria Growth Process

> "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

To achieve our ambitious carbon capture goals, we will employ state-of-the-art photobioreactors specifically engineered for accelerated and entirely unnatural growth rates of cyanobacteria. These photobioreactors will control light intensity and wavelength to optimizing conditions for unprecedented rates of cyanobacterial growth. Beyond light control, the system will meticulously regulate nutrient levels and temperature to maximize carbon capture efficiency continuously. To ensure sustainability, both water and nutrients will be recycled within the system, creating a closed-loop operation.

The subsequent stages of harvesting and compression are equally critical and are streamlined for efficiency. Ludicrously large, industrial-grade centrifuges will be utilized to extract all moisture from the cyanobacteria cells, yielding an ultra-dry biomass. This desiccated material is then subjected to high-pressure, geological like compression to form solid bricks. Each brick then undergoes a rigorous process where it is weighed, cataloged, imprinted, hermetically sealed and transported to long-term storage. 


## Bio-Matter Utilization and Drawbacks

> "The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails." - William Arthur Ward

Once the cyanobacteria have served their purpose in capturing carbon, the question arises: what to do with the biomass? Here are some options and their potential drawbacks:

### Biofuel Production
Converting the biomass into biofuel can be an attractive option. Media Tagline: "Turning Green Energy into Green Fuel!" Drawback: The combustion of biofuel would release the captured carbon back into the atmosphere.

### Fertilizer
Using the biomass as a natural fertilizer is another possibility. Media Tagline: "From Carbon Capture to Crop Booster!" Drawback: The natural decomposition of the biomass would release the captured carbon back into the atmosphere. 

### Animal Feed
The biomass could serve as a protein-rich feed for livestock. Media Tagline: "Feeding the Future Sustainably!" Drawback: While some of the captured carbon would be retained temporarily in the animal and excrement, its eventual decomposition would release the carbon back into the atmosphere.

### The Pyramid Approach
As an unconventional yet intriguing option, the biomass could be piled up to create a large pyramid. This approach offers several benefits: it's a straightforward method of storage, it could serve as a monument to human ingenuity, and it would sequester the captured carbon in a stable form for an extended period.



## Monetization: The Pyramid and Beyond

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

Given the scale of carbon capture, traditional methods of monetizing the captured carbon are impractical. Selling the physical carbon would either reintroduce it into the atmosphere or require additional carbon emissions for transportation. Moreover, the sheer volume of captured carbon would flood any existing market. Therefore, we propose a novel approach: building a pyramid with the captured biomass and monetizing it through mainly digital means. 

### Digital Carbon Offsets
We will offer digital representations of the captured carbon, which can be purchased by individuals, organizations, and countries to offset their carbon emissions. These digital assets will serve as verifiable tokens of carbon capture, backed by the physical pyramid. This creates a new, scalable market for real carbon offsets, without the need to move or worry about the physical carbon.

### Pyramid Tourism
In addition to digital offsets, we will monetize the pyramid itself as a tourist attraction. The perpetual construction of the pyramid will be a monumental feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity in the face of climate change. Tickets and tours will be offered throughout construction process, providing an educational experience and a tangible connection to the carbon capture project.

By combining digital carbon offsets with physical tourism, we create a sustainable revenue model that not only funds the ongoing carbon capture efforts but also engages the public in a meaningful way.



## Roadmap to Implementation: A Journey, Not a Sprint

> "I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship." - Louisa May Alcott

Before diving into the intricacies of our multi-phase plan, let's set the stage for where we currently stand. We're at the starting line of this ambitious endeavor, equipped with a vision and a roadmap, but still in the process of gathering the necessary resources. The following roadmap outlines the phases and milestones we aim to achieve, but it's crucial to note that we're in the initial stages of this journey. We're actively seeking funding, building our team, and laying the groundwork for each subsequent phase. Now, let's introduce you to the cornerstone of our project: our wilderness ranch.

### The Starting Point: The Wilderness Ranch
Our journey kicks off at our wilderness ranch, a place where duct tape is just as important as any high-tech gadget. This will be our sandbox for innovation, a place where we can roll up our sleeves and get to work on solving climate change.

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
The first order of business is to reliably grow cyanobacteria in a scalable manner. We'll use whatever resources we have at the ranch to make this happen, proving that our concept is more than just a pipe dream.

### Phase 2: One Human's Worth
With a proof of concept in hand, we'll aim to scale our system to offset the carbon emissions of a single person over a year. It's a small step, but a significant one, as it shows that our solution has real-world applicability.

### Phase 3: City-Scale Implementation
Once we've proven that we can offset the carbon footprint of one person, we'll set our sights on an entire city. We'll work diligently to scale our technology, always keeping the global community in the loop through real-time updates and interactive dialogues.

### Phase 4: Country-Scale Deployment
After successfully offsetting a city's worth of emissions, we'll be ready to take on a whole country. This will require substantial resources and partnerships, but we're committed to making it happen.

### Phase 5: Global Implementation
The penultimate phase involves scaling our solution to offset global emissions. By this point, we'll have a robust, well-tested system ready for worldwide deployment.

### Phase 6: Beyond the Present
The final phase is perhaps the most ambitious: offsetting historical and excessive natural emissions. This is the ultimate goal, and while it's a tall order, we're up for the challenge.

### The Commitment

This roadmap isn't set in stone; it's more like a sketch on a napkin. But it's a sketch we're committed to fleshing out, come what may. We're prepared to adapt, improvise, and overcome any obstacles that stand in our way.



## Conclusion

As we stand on the precipice of irreversible climate change, the need for scalable, sustainable solutions has never been more urgent. While the fossil fuel industry shows no signs of abating, and emissions are unlikely to reach zero in the foreseeable future, this paper presents a daring yet feasible approach to not just envision but actually implement a scalable carbon capture solution. Utilizing cyanobacteria as a bio-agent for carbon capture and storage (CCS), this proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy that encompasses key factors, global context, potential improvements, and a unique monetization model.

The audacity of this endeavor is not lost on us. However, the severity of the climate crisis demands that we explore every avenue, no matter how unconventional. Through a combination of biological innovation, digital assets, and public engagement, we aim to create a sustainable revenue model that not only funds ongoing carbon capture efforts but also involves the public in a meaningful way.

The timeline is ambitious, the risks are high, but the alternative is unthinkable. This may be our only solution; it must work. As we move forward, we invite collaboration, critique, and, most importantly, action. We urge you to get involved—whether through financial contributions, sharing this paper to increase its visibility, or providing valuable feedback. The time for debate is over; the time for action is now.

In simple terms, we're facing a climate crisis that's getting worse every day. To fight this, we're proposing a bold new way to capture and store carbon dioxide, one of the main culprits behind global warming. Imagine tiny organisms, called cyanobacteria, acting like little factories that suck in carbon dioxide and turn it into something solid. We're planning to grow these organisms in special containers, harvest them, and then turn them into bricks. These bricks will be used to build a pyramid—a permanent storage solution and a monument to human ingenuity.

But we're not stopping there. We're also creating digital tokens that represent the carbon we've captured. People can buy these tokens to offset their own carbon footprint. Plus, the pyramid itself will be a tourist attraction, providing another way to fund this massive project.

It's a big, audacious plan, but the climate crisis calls for nothing less. And we need your help to make it happen. Whether it's a small monthly donation or simply sharing our project with others, every bit counts.
