# Carbon Capture Using Cyanobacteria

## Introduction

The climate crisis is an existential threat that humanity can no longer afford to ignore. Despite global efforts to transition to renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency, carbon dioxide levels continue to rise, exacerbating global warming and its catastrophic consequences. This project introduces a novel approach to carbon capture and storage (CCS) using cyanobacteria, microorganisms capable of converting carbon dioxide into biomass through photosynthesis. The audacity of this endeavor is not lost on us; however, the urgency of the climate crisis demands innovative and bold solutions.

Our base of operations is a wilderness ranch designed to be a self-contained, self-sufficient community where participants can fully commit to the mission without external distractions. It's a place where efficiency meets inspiration, where the urgency of our task is balanced by the serenity of nature. The ranch houses state-of-the-art labs, workshops, and hangars, fully equipped for both research and implementation. This README serves as an introduction to our ambitious project, outlining the key components and inviting you to be part of this groundbreaking initiative.
