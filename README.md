# Pink Robotics: Where Audacity Meets Climate Action

## Introduction
Welcome to Pink Robotics, where audacious climate solutions come to life. In the face of climate change, we're not merely weathering the storm, we're harnessing its power. Our initiatives are for those who dare to dream big and take calculated risks. Here, innovation and audacity pave the way for real transformative climate action.

## Tackling Climate Change on Two Fronts

### Carbon Capture
In a world on fire, our Carbon Capture initiative aims to be a vital lifeline. By leveraging the innate carbon-absorbing capabilities of cyanobacteria, we're engineering a closed-loop system aimed at being a solution for the whole CO2 problem, even in the context of inevitable and ongoing fossil fuel emissions. For an in-depth exploration of the science and strategy behind our plans, refer to our [Carbon Capture Paper](https://github.com/PinkRobotics/PinkRobotics/blob/main/CarbonCapture.md).


### Airships
When it comes to combating wildfires, revitalizing parched landscapes and preventing floods, Airship are a legitimate game-changer. Imagine fleets of airships replacing sporadic rainfall and enabling precise water distribution at a global scale. This initiative is not just about firefighting; it's about reimagining how we interact with our environment. Check out our [Airships Paper](Airships.md).
