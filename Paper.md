## Introduction

> "Be the change that you wish to see in the world." - Mahatma Gandhi

The climate crisis is an existential threat that humanity can no longer afford to ignore. Despite global efforts to transition to renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency, carbon dioxide levels continue to rise, exacerbating global warming and its catastrophic consequences. All indications show that emissions will never go to zero, and the fossil fuel industry will continue for the foreseeable future. This unquestionably requires a truly scalable carbon capture solution to not only be envisioned but created, operated, and maintained indefinitely.

While various methods of carbon capture and storage (CCS) have been proposed and tested, they often come with their own set of challenges, such as high costs, energy-intensive processes, and uncertain long-term effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel approach to CCS using cyanobacteria as a bio-based solution to capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The audacity of this endeavor is not lost on the authors; however, the urgency of the climate crisis demands innovative and bold solutions. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key factors, calculations, and potential for scalability of this approach. It also addresses the challenges, risks, and ethical considerations involved, with the ultimate goal of presenting a viable, sustainable solution to one of the most pressing issues of our time.



## Our Base of Operations: A Wilderness Ranch for Climate Solutions

> "The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible." - Charles Kingsley

Imagine a place where the world's brightest minds come together, united by a singular mission: to combat climate change. Nestled in a remote, idyllic setting, this wilderness ranch serves as the epicenter of our audacious projects on carbon capture and airship-based water transportation. Picture a sprawling estate, spanning hundreds of acres, complete with varying terrains that serve as both a natural laboratory and a breathtaking backdrop for innovation.

### The Vision

The ranch is designed to be a self-contained, self-sufficient community where participants can fully commit to the mission without external distractions. It's a place where efficiency meets inspiration, where the urgency of our task is balanced by the serenity of nature.

The ranch will not just be a workplace but a home—a place where families can reside and where memories are made. It will be an educational hub, attracting students eager to contribute to the mission while learning from seasoned professionals.

### The Commitment

This is not a temporary endeavor but a long-term commitment. The ranch is the home base for what might be humanity's most crucial mission. While the challenges are immense, the alternative—doing nothing—is unthinkable. We are committed to navigating whatever obstacles lie ahead, adapting as needed but never losing sight of our ultimate goal: a sustainable solution to climate change.



## Key Factors and Calculations

> "In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity." - Albert Einstein

The growth rate of a specific type of cyanobacteria is about 0.41 per day. In specialized growth systems called photobioreactors, the density of these microorganisms can reach up to 7 billion cells per milliliter, which is roughly equivalent to 8 grams per liter. The carbon content in cyanobacteria is roughly half of its dry weight. Using these numbers, we estimate that cyanobacteria could capture about 4 grams of carbon per liter per day. Capturing 1 ton of carbon would equate to approximately 3.66 tons of CO2 captured.

### Global Context

To put this into perspective, let's consider that global carbon dioxide emissions are approximately 50 billion tons per year. At the estimated rate of 4 grams of carbon capture per liter per day, it would require about 13.7 trillion liters of cyanobacteria to offset these emissions in one year.

### Perspective on 13.7 Trillion Liters

To grasp the enormity of 13.7 trillion liters, consider that it would fill 5.5 million Olympic-sized swimming pools, equate to 4 times the annual water usage of New York City, or require a 1-meter diameter pipe of roughly 50 million kilometers, which would go around the Earth approximately 1,250 times. While these numbers may seem staggering, and perhaps even the subject of a joke, the reality is that we are running out of options. Reactions may range from disbelief to skepticism, but the question remains: what other choice do we have?

### Improvements and Optimizations

Genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and automation and robotics could significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of this carbon capture method. Genetic engineering could lead to strains of cyanobacteria that are more efficient at carbon capture and easier to harvest. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning algorithms, could optimize growth conditions in real-time, maximizing the rate of carbon capture. Automation and robotics would be critical to keep operational costs reasonable and to provide continuous operation, yielding relentless carbon capture capacity.


## Our Cyanobacteria Growth Process

> "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

We will utilize specialized photobioreactors to cultivate the cyanobacteria. These photobioreactors are designed to control light intensity and specific wavelengths, optimizing the conditions for rapid cyanobacterial growth. In addition to light, the system precisely controls nutrients and temperature. To make the process more sustainable, water and added nutrients are recycled within the system.

The harvesting and compression stages are equally streamlined. Large centrifuges will be employed to remove all water from the cyanobacteria, resulting in a dry biomass. This dry material is then compressed into solid bricks. Each brick undergoes a meticulous process where it is precisely weighted, accounted for, imprinted, and sealed. Finally, these bricks are transported to long-term storage.



## Bio-Matter Utilization and Drawbacks

> "The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails." - William Arthur Ward

Once the cyanobacteria have served their purpose in capturing carbon, the question arises: what to do with the biomass? Here are some options and their potential drawbacks:

### Biofuel Production
Converting the biomass into biofuel can be an attractive option. Media Tagline: "Turning Green Energy into Green Fuel!" Drawback: The combustion of biofuel would release the captured carbon back into the atmosphere.

### Fertilizer
Using the biomass as a natural fertilizer is another possibility. Media Tagline: "From Carbon Capture to Crop Booster!" Drawback: The natural decomposition of the biomass would release the captured carbon back into the atmosphere. 

### Animal Feed
The biomass could serve as a protein-rich feed for livestock. Media Tagline: "Feeding the Future Sustainably!" Drawback: While some of the captured carbon would be retained temporarily in the animal and excrement, its eventual decomposition would release the carbon back into the atmosphere.

### The Pyramid Approach
As an unconventional yet intriguing option, the biomass could be piled up to create a large pyramid. This approach offers several benefits: it's a straightforward method of storage, it could serve as a monument to human ingenuity, and it would sequester the captured carbon in a stable form for an extended period.



## Monetization: The Pyramid and Beyond

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

Given the scale of carbon capture, traditional methods of monetizing the captured carbon are impractical. Selling the physical carbon would either reintroduce it into the atmosphere or require additional carbon emissions for transportation. Moreover, the sheer volume of captured carbon would flood any existing market. Therefore, we propose a novel approach: building a pyramid with the captured biomass and monetizing it through mainly digital means. 

### Digital Carbon Offsets
We will offer digital representations of the captured carbon, which can be purchased by individuals, organizations, and countries to offset their carbon emissions. These digital assets will serve as verifiable tokens of carbon capture, backed by the physical pyramid. This creates a new, scalable market for real carbon offsets, without the need to move or worry about the physical carbon.

### Pyramid Tourism
In addition to digital offsets, we will monetize the pyramid itself as a tourist attraction. The perpetual construction of the pyramid will be a monumental feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity in the face of climate change. Tickets and tours will be offered throughout construction process, providing an educational experience and a tangible connection to the carbon capture project.

By combining digital carbon offsets with physical tourism, we create a sustainable revenue model that not only funds the ongoing carbon capture efforts but also engages the public in a meaningful way.



## Roadmap to Implementation: A Journey, Not a Sprint

> "I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship." - Louisa May Alcott

Before diving into the intricacies of our multi-phase plan, let's set the stage for where we currently stand. We're at the starting line of this ambitious endeavor, equipped with a vision and a roadmap, but still in the process of gathering the necessary resources. The following roadmap outlines the phases and milestones we aim to achieve, but it's crucial to note that we're in the initial stages of this journey. We're actively seeking funding, building our team, and laying the groundwork for each subsequent phase. Now, let's introduce you to the cornerstone of our project: our wilderness ranch.

### The Starting Point: The Wilderness Ranch
Our journey kicks off at our wilderness ranch, a place where duct tape is just as important as any high-tech gadget. This will be our sandbox for innovation, a place where we can roll up our sleeves and get to work on solving climate change.

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
The first order of business is to reliably grow cyanobacteria in a scalable manner. We'll use whatever resources we have at the ranch to make this happen, proving that our concept is more than just a pipe dream.

### Phase 2: One Human's Worth
With a proof of concept in hand, we'll aim to scale our system to offset the carbon emissions of a single person over a year. It's a small step, but a significant one, as it shows that our solution has real-world applicability.

### Phase 3: City-Scale Implementation
Once we've proven that we can offset the carbon footprint of one person, we'll set our sights on an entire city. We'll work diligently to scale our technology, always keeping the global community in the loop through real-time updates and interactive dialogues.

### Phase 4: Country-Scale Deployment
After successfully offsetting a city's worth of emissions, we'll be ready to take on a whole country. This will require substantial resources and partnerships, but we're committed to making it happen.

### Phase 5: Global Implementation
The penultimate phase involves scaling our solution to offset global emissions. By this point, we'll have a robust, well-tested system ready for worldwide deployment.

### Phase 6: Beyond the Present
The final phase is perhaps the most ambitious: offsetting historical and excessive natural emissions. This is the ultimate goal, and while it's a tall order, we're up for the challenge.

### The Commitment

This roadmap isn't set in stone; it's more like a sketch on a napkin. But it's a sketch we're committed to fleshing out, come what may. We're prepared to adapt, improvise, and overcome any obstacles that stand in our way.

In simple terms, we're facing a climate crisis that's getting worse every day. To fight this, we're proposing a bold new way to capture and store carbon dioxide, one of the main culprits behind global warming. Imagine tiny organisms, called cyanobacteria, acting like little factories that suck in carbon dioxide and turn it into something solid. We're planning to grow these organisms in special containers, harvest them, and then turn them into bricks. These bricks will be used to build a pyramid—a permanent storage solution and a monument to human ingenuity.

But we're not stopping there. We're also creating digital tokens that represent the carbon we've captured. People can buy these tokens to offset their own carbon footprint. Plus, the pyramid itself will be a tourist attraction, providing another way to fund this massive project.

It's a big, audacious plan, but the climate crisis calls for nothing less. And we need your help to make it happen. Whether it's a small monthly donation or simply sharing our project with others, every bit counts.
